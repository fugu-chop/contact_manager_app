A practice project for the Launch School JS239 Take Home Assessment. 

I am focusing on implementing event listeners and interacting with an API, so I won't be spending time on CSS and styling.

I'll also try to implement an MVC pattern as practice. I've never implemented MVC before, so it will be an interesting opportunity to try it out.
